This latent vector should produce an image that is visually similar to the input image  Why is this useful? With the latent vector (and given that semantic features are disentangled in the latent space), we can move along different dimensions in the latent space to change semantic features of the input image (e.g., age in the case of face images, or color in the case of vehicle images)    Generative Adversarial Networks A GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) is composed of a generator and descriminator. During training, the generator aims to synthesize images that resemble the training data, while the descriminator aims to descriminate between real and synthesized data. The two models are trained simultaneously in an adversarial process. After training, the generator can be used to produce synthetic images that resemble images from the training domain.\n The input to the generator is a vector $z \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$, where $d$ is the dimensionality of the generator\u0026rsquo;s latent space. During training, $z$ is drawn from a simple distribution (e.g., Gaussian,) that the generator maps to images  $G: \\mathcal{Z} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{X}$. $\\mathcal{G}$ is the generator, $\\mathcal{Z}$ is the latent space of the generator, and $\\mathcal{X}$ is the image domain    GAN Inversion GAN inversion aims to map a target image to a latent vector in $\\mathcal{Z}$. This inverted latent vector can be used to generate an image that (1) photorealistically reconstructs the target image and (2) facilitates downstream tasks such as image editting (i.e., moving the inverted latent vector in the latent space produce meaningful change in the generated image.)\n To solve (1) you must minimize the \u0026ldquo;distance\u0026rdquo; between the input image and the generated image. Because $G(z)$ is a non-convex function, this problem is challenging Solving (2) is directly related to the choice of the GAN\u0026rsquo;s latent space, not so much the inversion technique  Often times, it is possible to obtain a latent vector that completely satisfies (1). However, the region of latent space around this vector may not allow for semantic control The classical latent space is the $\\mathcal{Z}$ space. This space usually entangles semantic features, making it difficult to generate feature combinations that were not seen in the training data  Latent spaces that disentangle the semantic features have become popular. Some examples are the W space (from StyleGAN), W+ space, and S space      Approaches to GAN inversion Approaches to GAN inversion can be classified into three categories: learning based, optimization based, and hybrid.\nLearning based Learning based approaches involve training an encoder/decoder style architecture to predict the latent vector of any target image. In this case, the encoder is trained and the generator is used as a static decoder. An encoder $E$ parameterized by $\\theta_{E}$ is trained with the following objective:\n$$\\theta_E^* \\ \\underset{\\theta_E}{argmin} \\sum_n \\mathcal{L}(G(E(x_n; \\theta_{E})), x_n) \\quad (1)$$\nWhere $\\mathcal{L}$ is a similarity metric between two images, $G$ is a generator, and $x_n$ is the $n$th training image. The training set consists of (image, latent vector) pairs thats are obtained by passing randomly sampled latent vectors through the generator. After training, an image can be passed through the encoder and the output should be be a latent vector that best reconstructs the input image in the generator (assuming a well trained encoder.) This approach typically performs better than optimization based approaches and does not fall into local optima.\nOptimization based Optimization based approaches attempt to find the latent vector of a target image through directly optimizing the following:\n$$z_* = \\underset{z}{argmin} \\ {\\mathcal{L}(G(z, \\theta), x)} \\quad (2)$$\nWhere $G$ is a generator parameterized by $\\theta$, and $x$ is the target image. Typically, the latent vector is optimized via gradient descent. This approach is prone to falling into local optima because (2) is highly non-convex, thus a good initialization is critical for finding a suitable latent vector (some approaches select the best of many random initializations while other train a DNN to select many initializations.) This approach can be computationally expensive since the optimization procedure must be performed for every target image (as opposed to learning based approaches which, once trained, only require a single forward pass.)\nHybrid based Hybrid based approaches adopt strategies from both learning and optimization based approaches. Typically, hybrid approaches perform the following:\n Train an encoder $E$ to predict a latent vector from an image Use the latent vector produced from $E(x)$ as initialization to the optimizer  ","date":1645198603,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1645198603,"objectID":"46a3483c54de7e56e77c040407e27f11","permalink":"https://dominickrei.github.io/post/gan-inversion/","publishdate":"2022-02-18T10:36:43-05:00","relpermalink":"/post/gan-inversion/","section":"post","summary":"Summary  Given a latent vector, a GAN generates a photorealistic image that is in the domain the GAN was trained on  This is the classical use case of GANs.","tags":[],"title":"GAN Inversion","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Link to Paper\nMotivation  IoT devices are ubiquitous and communicate with one another over wireless networks  These communications (packets) can be intercepted and observed by an adversary. Typically the content is encrypted to prevent sensitive data leakage   Statistical analysis can be performed on these packets, regardless of content encryption, to reveal information about the packet  Known as side-channel attack This paper focuses on side-channel attacks against packet size   Existing solutions do not provide tunable or optimized privacy  Technical Summary  We observe a sequence of packet sizes: $X_1, X_2, \u0026hellip;, X_n : X_i \\in \\mathcal{X}$ where $\\mathcal{X}$ is the set of all possible packet sizes  Each $X_i$ is assumed to be i.i.d   Each observed packet size follows a distribution $p_v(X=x)$ that is a member of a family of distribtions denoted $\\mathcal{P}$  $\\mathcal{P}$ may represent many different IoT devices (a camera likely sends larger packets than a sleep monitor,) or different states of the same IoT device (a device in active mode likely sends larger packets than a device in sleep mode.)

Image data may contain sensitive information, such as face and iris, which can be misused if in the hands of an adversary. Widely used image obfuscation methods include blurring or mosaicing those sensitive  egions. However, they are prone to inference attacks, and do not provide quantifiable privacy guarantees. Recently, several image/video obfuscation approaches have been proposed  that satisfy the rigorous notion of differential privacy. In this work, we synthesize those approaches in the context of obfuscating face and iris images and analyze their privacy  guarantees. Furthermore, we conduct a comparative evaluation of those methods regarding practical utility and privacy protection, with real-world face and iris image datasets. We  find that DP-SVD performs best on several privacy and utility measures while providing provable privacy guarantees. Moreover, we recommend practices for applying differentially  private image obfuscation to novel data requiring unique privacy and utility constraints","tags":[],"title":"A Comparative Evaluation for Differentially Private Image Obfuscation","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"DP-Shield is an aggregation and comprehensive evaluation of differentially private image obfuscation techniques.\n","date":1627776000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1627776000,"objectID":"90ea0d89bc2c0c3cb42b5b676e57c307","permalink":"https://dominickrei.github.io/project/dpshield/","publishdate":"2021-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/dpshield/","section":"project","summary":"An framework aggregationg and standardizing differentially private image obfuscation algorithms","tags":["Data Privacy","Machine Learning","Computer Vision"],"title":"DP-Shield","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"SocialBit is a smartwatch app for classifying the social interaction of stroke patients.
